# üè° pyjama.sh

This project provides a simple way to display inspirational quotes on your desktop wallpaper using PowerShell scripts. The quotes are fetched from a text file hosted on a web server, and the script updates the quote each time you log in.

## üö© Features

- Fetches random quotes from a hosted `quotes.txt` file.
- Saves the selected quote to a local text file.
- Displays the quote on your desktop using a message box (or any other method you prefer).
- Easy to set up and use.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Windows operating system.
- PowerShell (comes pre-installed on Windows).
- Internet access to fetch quotes from the web.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download it as a ZIP file.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pjdotdev/pyjama.sh
   ```

2. **Create the Quotes File**: Create a `quotes.txt` file in the root of your repository (or on your web server) and populate it with inspirational quotes in the following format:

   ```
   "Quote text" ‚Äì Author Name
   ```

   Example:
   ```
   "Leadership is not about being in charge. It is about taking care of those in your charge." ‚Äì Simon Sinek
   ```

3. **Edit the PowerShell Script**: Open the `fetch.ps1` script and update the `$quotesUrl` variable to point to the location of your `quotes.txt` file.

   ```powershell
   $quotesUrl = "https://pyjama.sh/quotes.txt"  # Replace with the actual URL
   ```

4. **Run the Script**: You can run the script manually or set it to run at startup.

   To run the script manually, open PowerShell and execute:

   ```powershell
   irm "https://pyjama.sh/fetch.ps1" | iex
   ```

5. **Set Up Automatic Execution**: To run the script automatically at login, you can create a scheduled task or add a shortcut to the script in the Startup folder.

   - **Using Task Scheduler**:
     - Open Task Scheduler and create a new task that runs the PowerShell script at logon.
   - **Using Startup Folder**:
     - Create a shortcut to the script and place it in the Startup folder (`shell:startup`).

## üçö Customization

- You can customize how the quote is displayed by modifying the `fetch.ps1` script. For example, you can replace the message box with a method to update your desktop wallpaper or use a tool like BGInfo to display the quote on your desktop background.

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstall

Open PowerShell and run the following command to execute the uninstall script:
```ps1
irm "https://pyjama.sh/uninstall-bginfo.ps1" | iex
```
